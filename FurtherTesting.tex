% \section{Synthetic Tests}

% \subsection{Motivation}

% \item To establish a notion that base harmonic similarity is being tested

% \subsection{Repeating sequences}

% \item Does repeating sequences affect scores

% \subsection{Random sequences}

% \item Establish a statistical distribution

% \section{Comparison to Ground-Truth Data}

% \subsection{Raw harmonic difference}

% \item Difference between chord transcription files using time-sequence data

% \item Using Smith-Waterman

% \subsection{Difference in fully complete pairwise graph}

% \item Quantifying differences in graph between groundtruth and extracted datasets

% \subsection{Difference in querying database by chord progression}
