\section{Computational Chord Extraction Methods}

\subsection{Background}

Chord progressions

\item Using state-of-the-art chord progression extraction algorithms, how can we feabibly compare two harmonic progressions inexactly?

\subsection{Methodology}

\item How common algorithms work

\subsection{MIR Contest}

\item Evaluation
\item Khalkevid and other chord extraction methods

\subsection{Chordino}

\item Vamp plugin
\item Good recall
\item Got it working as a command line interface with Python and C
\item Acknowledge common pitfalls in identification
