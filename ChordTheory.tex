\subsection{Chords and Harmonies}

A chord consists of a combination of notes sounding simultaneously or close enough in succession to resemble a texture. The \textit{Harvard Dictionary of Music} defines a chord as consisting of at least three notes\cite{harvdict}. A chord perceptually describes the notes that are contained within.

Chords are commonly described with qualities, which describe the intervals between the pitches involved. A \textit{root note} describes the base upon which successive intervals are based. For example, given a specified root, a \textit{major} chord consists of notes 4 semitones above the root and 7 semitones above the root, invariant of octave. This means that notes in a C major chord must be 4 and 7 semitones above the root modulus 12. See figure ~\ref{fig:qualitytable} for a sample of commonly named chord qualities and the associated intervals.

A chord with only 3 notes in which successive intervals are in the same octave is called a \textit{triad}. A C major triad is demonstrated in figure ~\ref{fig:cmajorchord1}.
% The octave of these successive notes can be incremented or decremented freely, and the chord is still considered to have a \textit{major} quality. See figure for a C major chord in root position.

% Chords feature a \textit{root note} which is the note around which the \textit{quality} is based.

% The lowest note (note with the lowest pitch) within a \textit{root position} chord is called its \textit{root note}.

% A chord typically has a root note, the note with the lowest pitch, and a quality, which describes the arrangement of successive notes' pitches.
