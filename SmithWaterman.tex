\section{Sequence Alignment}

Sequence alignment refers to the computational task of trying to find common subsequences within two different sequences with minimal gaps. As a simplified example, consider trying to align the following words:

% -atte
%  || |
% pat-e

\section{Smith-Waterman Algorithm}

The Smith-Waterman algorithm is used to find optimal local alignments between two sequences based on a cost matrix for symbols of the alphabet being used and defined gap costs.

A matrix $H$ is constructed in the following manner:
\[ H(i,0) = 0, 0 \leq i \leq m \]
\[ H(0,j) = 0, 0 \leq j \leq n \]
\[ H(i,j) = \hbox{max} \begin{cases} 0 \\ H(i-1,j-1)+s(a_i,b_j) \\ \hbox{max}_{k \geq 1} \left\{ H(i-k,j)+W_k \right\} \\ \hbox{max}_{l \geq 1}\left\{ H(i, j-l)+W_l) \right\} \end{cases}  \]
