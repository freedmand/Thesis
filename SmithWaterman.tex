\section{Smith-Waterman Algorithm}

The Smith-Waterman algorithm is used to find optimal local alignments between two sequences based on a cost matrix for symbols of the alphabet being used and defined gap costs.

A matrix $H$ is constructed in the following manner:
\[ H(i,0) = 0, 0 \leq i \leq m \]
\[ H(0,j) = 0, 0 \leq j \leq n \]
% \[ H(i,j) = \hbox{max} \begin{cases} 0 & H(i-1,j-1)+s(a_i,b_j) & \hbox{max}_{k \geq 1}\left{ H(i-k,j)+W_k \right} & \hbox{max}_{l \geq 1}\left{ H(i, j-l)+W_l) \right} \end{cases}$  \]
