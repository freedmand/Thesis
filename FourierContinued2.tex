It is important to note that automatic pitch identification of audio is inexact. The complex, rich sound of instruments and voices have \textit{overtones}, or frequencies that are multiples of the perceived pitch. Noise, or extraneous sound, gets in the way of recordings. The quantization of audio files and inexactness of recording equipment and synthesizers prevents perfect data collection. Multiple melodic lines make it hard to isolate regions or discern between multiple parts. There are more complicated means of identifying pitches that take into account \textit{timbral} aspects of instruments, color and overtones, but the subjective nature of pitch interpretation means definitive truths are hard to establish, and the computational task of hearing as a human might broaches the field of artificial intelligence.
