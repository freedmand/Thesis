Chord identification in audio is a challenging task that relies on extracting information about underlying notes, their pitches, interactions, and timbres, and classifying associated chord qualities.

% A common difficulty in the task of identifying chords is the difficulty in establishing ground truth data upon which automatically identified chords can be compared (ref). Another difficulty is that a progression of chords may involve chords that are overlapping, have notes that linger or are anticipated, may involve notes outside of the tuning of the chromatic scale, or may involve unknown chord qualities.
