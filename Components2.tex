\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item We want to compare harmonic similarity between 2 songs in an efficient manner
\item Problems:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Ground-truth data takes too long to collect (~12-19 mins per person, over an hour in complex music, human error)
    \end{itemize}
\item Turn to music information retrieval research
\item Contest hosted yearly to find best chord retrieval algorithms (~80% correct identification rate)
\item Using these models, can we compare harmonic progressions in a manner that accounts for inaccuracies and performs well despite this
\end{itemize}
