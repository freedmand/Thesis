\section{Smith-Waterman Results}

\subsection{Normalization}

\item Problem, just given a raw score independent of song length or anything else

\item Attempt to solve: $normalization$ $equation$ $used$

\subsection{Clustering}

\item Tried out using graph clustering algorithm

\item Future: try k-means

\section{Visualization}

\subsection{Motivation}

\item Given over 100 pairwise (triangle) number comparisons between sets of songs, it is important to have a useful means of visualizing the data

\item Initially tried using Graphos and Circos and other graphing libraries

\item Demanded a level of interactivity unachievable with other programs

\subsection{Using D3.js}

D3, a Javascript library, if used to create the visualization. All songs are displayed as radial nodes around a circle, and pairwise connections as edges.

\item Using popular javascript graphing library, can construct a visualization based on hierarchical edge bundling, as used in other modern graphing libraries (curved edges using tension factors)

\item Can add interactivity using web server

\subsection{Using Twistd webserver}

\item Facile, easy use web server all in Python. Link C libraries to Python and have a rapid coding environment that has fast native C-code at its base

\item Can compare align results in a visual interface based on reconstructing the aligned data

\subsection{Audio playback}

\item Audio transposition problem, and solution using fewest localized transpositions

\item Following along using popcorn.js

\subsection{Public implementation}

\item Webserver available at chordmatch.com
