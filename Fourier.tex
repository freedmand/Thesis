\subsection{Classifying pitches from audio files}

The \textit{Fourier transform} is a mathematical algorithm that can be used to extract frequencies from a series of amplitudes. The Fourier transform can be applied to an audio file using a \textit{sliding window} in which the data points are analyzed in chunks. The size of the window is a balance in precision---the larger the window the finer the frequency resolution; the smaller the window the more closely note onsets and offsets can be detected.

Most modern audio files are sampled at 44000 $Hz$, which means that there are 44,000 data points for every second of audio.
