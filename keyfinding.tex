The calculation of $j$ consists of deriving four sets of tonal space for each chord Lerdahl outlines in which each subsequent level is a superset of the previous level. Level 1, $L_1$, of a chord $c$ returns a set only containing the chord's root note: \[L_1(c) = \{root(c)\}\] Level 2, $L_2$, returns a set containing a given chord's root note and fifth interval: \[L_2(c) = \{root(c), V(c)\}\] Level 3, $L_3$, returns a set containing all the pitch classes in a given chord: \[L_3(c) = P_c(c)\] Finally, level 4, $L_4$, consists of all the pitch classes in the key signature given: \[L_4(c,k) = P_c(k)\]
