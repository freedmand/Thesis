% \section{Distance Function between Chords and Gap Costs}

% \subsection{Considerations}

% \item Should perform well comparing extracted data set to ground truth sets following MIR data (also separate from MIR set is valuable as untrained data).

% \item Should classify chords with similar notes as similar, and place emphasis moreso on pitch class so as to avoid errors with key recognition and such

% \subsection{Tonal Pitch-Step Distance}

% \item Motivations, research, circle-of-fifths step

% \item Dependence on key information, impracticality

% \subsection{Harte Distance Metric}

% The Harte chord distance metric, proposed by Christopher Harte in \cite{harte2010towards}, is a simple and convenient means of calculating a score representing the distance between any two chords.

% Letting $P_c$ represent the given pitch classes of a chord, we can define Harte's formula as follows:
% \[ H(c_1,c_2) = \frac{\left| P_c(c_1) \cap P_c(c_2) \right|}{\left| P_c(c_1) \cup P_c(c_2) \right|} \]

% \item Advantages: easy to implement, fast, concise

% \item Disadvantages: does not consider full range of key in music. Ignores root.

% \subsection{Other chord distance metrics}

% \item List others in Survey paper. Outside scope but could be tested in the future.
