  abstract = {The Computational Analysis of the Live Music Archive (CALMA) project aims to facilitate investigation and scholarship related to live music through development of a Linked Data service combining metadata captured during deposition of audio to the Internet Archive, with computational analyses over these recordings through feature extraction, clustering, and classification. In this poster and demonstrator we introduce the architecture, tools, and data structures we have developed to create this combined resource, and provide a first release of the dataset including provenance metadata to assist its interrogation and reuse. We also show the early results of questions assessed over the data that (i) aid resolution of uncertain metadata, identification of potential errors, and validation of existing entries, and (ii) provide metrics for broad patterns in performance variation that can be used to select subsets within the data for further longitudinal and musicological study.},
