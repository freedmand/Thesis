\subsection{Clustering}

One natural experiment after obtaining data corresponding to all the pairwise combinations of songs in a dataset, is to attempt clustering. I used the Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL)\footnote{http://micans.org/mcl/} with custom-tuned parameters to attempt to find groups of Billboard 2014 songs that were connected well with one another. After some experimentation with parameters, the largest cluster result returned contained:\\

\{\textit{Call Me Maybe}\text{ by Carly Rae Jepsen}, \textit{Heart Attack}\text{ by Demi Lovato}, \textit{Whistle}\text{ by FloRide}, \textit{Cruise}\text{ by Florida Georgia Line}, \textit{Stereo Hearts ft. Adam Levine}\text{ by Gym Class Heroes}, \textit{The Edge of Glory}\text{ by Lady Gaga}, \textit{Live While We're Young}\text{ by One Direction}, \textit{Try}\text{ by P!nk}, and \textit{If I Die Young}\text{ by The Band Perry}\}

\subsection{Normalization}

\item Problem, just given a raw score independent of song length or anything else

\item Attempt to solve: $normalization$ $equation$ $used$

\subsection{Clustering}

\item Tried out using graph clustering algorithm

\item Future: try k-means

\section{Visualization}

\subsection{Motivation}

\item Given over 100 pairwise (triangle) number comparisons between sets of songs, it is important to have a useful means of visualizing the data

\item Initially tried using Graphos and Circos and other graphing libraries

\item Demanded a level of interactivity unachievable with other programs

\subsection{Using D3.js}

D3, a Javascript library, if used to create the visualization. All songs are displayed as radial nodes around a circle, and pairwise connections as edges.

\item Using popular javascript graphing library, can construct a visualization based on hierarchical edge bundling, as used in other modern graphing libraries (curved edges using tension factors)

\item Can add interactivity using web server

\subsection{Using Twistd webserver}

\item Facile, easy use web server all in Python. Link C libraries to Python and have a rapid coding environment that has fast native C-code at its base

\item Can compare align results in a visual interface based on reconstructing the aligned data

\subsection{Audio playback}

\item Audio transposition problem, and solution using fewest localized transpositions

\item Following along using popcorn.js

\subsection{Public implementation}

\item Webserver available at chordmatch.com
