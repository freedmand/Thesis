\subsection{Notes: The Basic Building Block}

In music, a \textit{note} is the most basic element. A note is based on pitch, a subjective and perceptual property. Though the pitch of a note is closely related and usually resembles its objective physical frequency (as measured in Hertz, or cycles per second, of a waveform), pitch differs in that its semantic meaning is derived from the listener. This distinction can be demonstrated with a visual analogy used by Terheardt\cite{terhardt1974pitch} in figure~\ref{fig:virtualpitch2} in which the word \smallcaps{PITCH} is apparent even though the visual information suggests only shadow -- a pitch can be heard even if its perceived frequency is not physically present. A note also consists of a duration.
