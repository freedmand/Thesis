\subsection{Notes: The Basic Building Block}

In music, a \textit{note} is the most basic element. A note is based on pitch, a subjective and perceptual property rather than an objective physical property. Though the pitch of a note is closely related and usually identical to its objective physical frequency (as measured in Hertz, or cycles per second, of a waveform), pitch differs in that its semantic meaning is derived from the listener. A note also consists of a duration.



The divergence between exactly measurable and calculable to subjectively derived from perception---at the most basic element of music---gives birth to the field of \textit{music informatics retrieval} (MIR), devoted to automatically extracting data and classifying features from works of music.
