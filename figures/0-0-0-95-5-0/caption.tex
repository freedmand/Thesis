[Ranking values between optimal variable set of Smith-Waterman over McGill ground-truth and extracted databases] A scatter plot of the ranking values between the optimal variable set of the Smith-Waterman algorithm run on McGill ground-truth and extracted databases. The x-axis corresponds to the extracted database rankings, and the y-axis corresponds to the ground-truth rankings. The data should look like it increases linearly in a diagonal line.
