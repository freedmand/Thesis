[Visual quantization analogy]Quantizing data to fit into a computer. The circle on the left represents continuous data. The circle in the middle shows the grid upon which the data will fit once its values are made discrete. The circle on the right shows the final quantized result displayable on a computer. Likewise, audio must be quantized when stored digitally.
