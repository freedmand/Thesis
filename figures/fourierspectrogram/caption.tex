[Spectrogram of Fourier Transforms by Window Size]A spectrogram of Fourier transformations by window size on the same melodic line consisting of synthesized notes $A$, $B$, and $C\sharp$ sustained for two seconds each. As the window size increases, the width of each band depicting the notes being played narrows, corresponding to more attuned frequency resolution. Likewise, the vertical band representing error in identifying transitions between notes shrinks as window size decreases.
