[3D Histogram of ranking values between optimal variable set of Smith-Waterman over McGill ground-truth and extracted databases] A 3D histogram of the ranking values between the optimal variable set of the Smith-Waterman algorithm run on McGill ground-truth and extracted databases. The x-axis corresponds to the extracted database rankings, the y-axis corresponds to the ground-truth rankings, and the z-axis corresponds to relative occurrence. The diagonal, monotonically increasing nature of the data is made more evident in this 3D representation.
