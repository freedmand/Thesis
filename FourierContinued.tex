Pitch classification of a segment of audio corresponds to finding peaks in this array of magnitude values. Often, spectrograms are condensed into an octave invariant representation called a \textit{chromagram} in which each note across all octaves is compounded into a single bin. A chromagram of the same excerpt of \textit{Eleanor Rigby} can be found in figure~\ref{fig:eleanor_chroma}.
